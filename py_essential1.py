# As you surely know, due to some astronomical reasons, years may be leap or common. The former are 366 days long, while the latter are 365 days long.

# Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (in 1582), the following rule is used to determine the kind of year:

# if the year number isn't divisible by four, it's a common year;
# otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year;
# otherwise, if the year number isn't divisible by 400, it's a common year;
# otherwise, it's a leap year.
# Look at the code in the editor â€“ it only reads a year number, and needs to be completed with the instructions implementing the test we've just described.
